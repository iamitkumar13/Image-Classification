# Image-Classification

We implemented four popular ML methods, including Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes classifier and ANN
to discuss how to apply picture classification in machine learning. Deep learning(CNN) is preferred for image classification jobs 
due to the low accuracy of traditional methods
